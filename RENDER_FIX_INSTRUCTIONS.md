# Render Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your build failed because `vite` is in devDependencies but needed during production build.

## The Fix
Replace your current `package.json` with the content from `package-fixed.json`:

1. In your GitHub repository, delete the current `package.json`
2. Rename `package-fixed.json` to `package.json`  
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Redeploy on Render

## What Changed
Moved these build tools from devDependencies to dependencies:
- vite
- esbuild  
- tailwindcss
- autoprefixer
- drizzle-kit
- tsx
- typescript
- @vitejs/plugin-react

## Alternative Quick Fix
Update your Render build command to:
```
npm install --include=dev && npm run build
```

This forces installation of devDependencies during build.

## After Fix
Your deployment should succeed and the app will be live with:
- Instagram/YouTube/TikTok downloading
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Beautiful forest-themed UI
- Rate limiting protection
